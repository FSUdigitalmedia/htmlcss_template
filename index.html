    <p>Click the "Go Live" button in VS Code so you can see the effects of your changes as you make them.</p>

    <p>Make some changes to this HTML page. Try to include some tags that we didn't go over in class.
    You can find out more about HTML on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3schools HTML tutorial</a>.
    Maybe try to imagine something you'd like to add to the document and find the tags needed to do it.
    (For example: a table, a button, an emoji, etc.)
    </p>

    <p>Make some changes to the formatting of the page by editing the CSS file.
